                <h2>IT Systems Administrator</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Thompson, and I am currently a student enrolled at the University of North
                    Carolina at Charlotte perusing a degree in Computer Science.
                    I have gained experience in the Java programming language through the courses I have taken so far
                    and have created a few programs for class projects and exams.</p>
                <p>I have been working with technology just about my entire life. Whether it is smartphones, home
                    computers, or servers I have experience with building,
                    repairing as well as troubleshooting with these systems.
                    I also have experience working with software and or OS’s that run on different types of systems.
                    From MacOS to Windows to Linux I have used and had experience with each of these different
                    environments.</p>
